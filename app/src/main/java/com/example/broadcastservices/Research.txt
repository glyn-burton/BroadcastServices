1. What is the difference in an started service and a bound service?
Started services will run until they complete a task and then stop afterwards, unless they are stopped manually.
Bound services will run until they are unbound.

2. Define what a observer/ subscriber relation is.
There is an object that is an Observer, and the subscribers will be notified about the changes/messages of
what the Observer is keeping track of.

3. Define what a client/server relation is.
There is one server and several clients, and the server hold and processes info. Clients can request data from the server
and the server can accept these requests, process them and return the data to the client.

4. Define each of the HTTP verbs
POST - It is mostly associated with the CRUD create method, and is used to create the resource.
GET - To retrieve/read the resource.
PUT - Related to update, it will place the resource, replacing/updating if applicable.
PATCH - It is similar to put, but it only updates and modifies an already present resource.
DELETE - This deletes a resource.

5. Describe at least one use for each service (Foreground, Background, Intent, Bound)
Foreground - Continuous service that notifies the user what it's up to, ala Spotify.
Background - Indexing, processing or collecting data, stuff the user wouldn't have to see.
Intent - Can be used to process services you don't want processed on the main thread, and
start as needed. Could be used for a live score board.
Bound - A process that has a client-server interface. Something like this would be a customer support
chat system.
